# Gender Prediction from handwritting using CNN model
   Gender prediction from handwritten documents was done using approaches built for writer identification task, they explore the information the handwriting provides both textural and allographic, from contour directions, Gabor filters to lines text, words and even letters grouping. These methods usually start with choosing the necessary dataset that contains handwriting samples accompanied with gender information, then a feature engineering step where the scientists experiment on multiple features to training the suitable classifier at the end. In our study, we try to automate the feature extractions step by taking advantage of artificial neural networks, especially the deep learning neural network models that proven their effectiveness in object detection and classification problems, to be more specific, our approach is based on an end-to-end convolutional neural network trained on a dataset of handwritten text images.
